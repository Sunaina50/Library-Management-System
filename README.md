# Library Management System

## Overview

The **Library Management System** is a console-based application built in Java that provides an interactive way to manage books in a library. Users can add, search, check out, and return books, with data stored and retrieved from a file to maintain the state of the library.

## Features

- **Add Books**: Add new books to the library collection by specifying the title and author.
- **Search Books**: Search for books using keywords that match either the title or the author.
- **Check Out Books**: Mark a book as checked out, preventing other users from borrowing it until it is returned.
- **Return Books**: Return books that were previously checked out.
- **Persistent Storage**: Book data is saved to a file (`library.txt`) and reloaded every time the system starts, ensuring data persistence.
- **User Login System**: Users can log in as existing users or create new accounts to interact with the library system.
